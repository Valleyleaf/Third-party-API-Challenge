# < Third Part API challenge>

## Description

This project was created as a way to keep track of daily items. Each item is saved locally and can be over-written if needed. The purpose of this challenge was to learn how to use local storage within Javascript. This challenge has taught me not only how to use localStorage, but also to remember to break down my functions into even smaller pieces. One of the big challenges for me is that i still make my functions way too big, which can make them confusing and difficult to de-bug. So a reminder for the future is to not do that and instead try to use multible functions with lots of console.logs. By creating a program that works first and foremost, I can then go back to optimzie it and make it better. Additionally, I have learned how to integrate API's into my projects. In this example, I used dayJS to color-code each hour to show which hours have passed, what hour we are on and what hours are to come. I would personally from a design perspective probably change the current hour to yellow and past hours to red but thats an item for another more free-form project.

## Installation

Open in browser of your choice. Enter the items you wish to save and hit the save icon. After refreshing, your items will still be there.


## Usage

## How to Contribute

Feel free to optimize this and add additional features. If I had more time, I would have liked to add a "Clear" button to remove all saved variables in the local storage. May take a look back in the future to do this.
